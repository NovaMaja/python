        "the import statement lets us import other python files into our program. It can be a file that we wrote ourselves, or it can be a file someone else wrote. In most cases we import external libraries (python files someone else wrote) to get access to functions that handle anything from building neural networks to plotting images and graphs or develop games. The great thing about imports is that you do not have to re-invent the wheel. If someone else wrote code that you want to use, and they made it available you can easily import it into your program.\n",

If you study source code and documentation of Python you will find quite a few references to Monty Python and other sillyness, in fact it is encouraged. Some examples are found when importing certain built in libraries (= python files someone else wrote that was included with Python when it was installed on your computer) in Python.\n",
